**Project Title** Ride-hailing Optimization and Customer Preference Analysis


**Project Description**
This project delves into the intricacies of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, focusing on optimizing operations and understanding customer preferences.
The analysis uses a comprehensive dataset from Uber and Lyft in Boston, covering various aspects like pricing, ride types and weather conditions.
It aims to benefit stakeholders like riders, ride-hailing companies and regulatory bodies by providing insights into fair pricing, service optimization and policy development.

**Technologies Used**
Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.


**Requirements**
To run the code from the "Ride-hailing Optimization and Customer Preference Analysis" project, you will need the following libraries:
1. NumPy: For numerical operations.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. Matplotlib: For data visualization.
4. Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization.
5. Scikit-learn: For machine learning and data preprocessing.


**Installation Instructions**
To install the necessary libraries for your project in a Jupyter Notebook environment, you can simply run the installation commands as cells within the notebook.

## Here's how you can do it:
* Open a new cell at the top of your Jupyter Notebook.
* Enter the installation commands, prefixing them with an exclamation point ! to indicate that they are shell commands.

### For example:
!pip install numpy
!pip install pandas
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install seaborn
!pip install scikit-learn


**Usage Instructions** 
## Data Structure and Format:
* The scripts expect input data in CSV format.
* Ensure your dataset contains columns relevant to ride-hailing analysis, such as pricing, ride types, and weather conditions.

## Running the Analysis Scripts:
1. Start by running the "1_DataCleaning.ipynb" notebook to clean and prepare the data.
2. Proceed with "2_ExploratoryDataAnalysis1.ipynb" for initial data exploration.
3. Use "3_Assumptions.ipynb" to check various assumptions relevant to the data.
4. Follow with "4_Regression_Comparative Analysis.ipynb" for regression analysis.
5. Finally, run "5_Factor&_SegmentationAnalysis.ipynb" for more advanced analysis, including factor and segmentation analysis.

* Each notebook contains detailed instructions and comments explaining the code and the analysis process.
* Ensure that each notebook is run in sequence as they may depend on the outputs and processed data from the previous steps. â€‹


**Documentation** Detailed comments within the code explaining each step of the analysis.


**Project Roadmap** FURTHER RESEARCH SUGGESTIONS
* Geographical Variations: Explore how these factors vary across different regions or cities.
* Long-Term Trends: Assess how consumer preferences and pricing factors evolve over time. 
* Impact of External Factors: Investigate the influence of socio-economic changes and technological advancements on ride-hailing services.
